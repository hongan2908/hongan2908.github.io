_“The world moves fast, but I lead with positivity.”_

I’m a graduate student in **Applied Business Analytics** at Boston University and hold a Bachelor’s in **Global Business and Entrepreneurship** from Suffolk University.

I'm passionate about using data to help organizations make smarter decisions — especially in areas like **Finance, Marketing, and AI**.

As a young professional, I’m actively exploring job opportunities where I can grow, contribute, and create meaningful impact through data.

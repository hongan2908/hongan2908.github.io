# 👋 Hi, I'm An Ly

![An Ly – Profile Photo](profile.jpg){width=180px style="border-radius: 12px;"}

I'm a graduate student in **Applied Business Analytics** at Boston University. I earned my Bachelor's degree in **Global Business and Entrepreneurship** from Suffolk University, where I cultivated a passion for international markets and data-driven strategy.

My goal is to become a business analyst in fields like **Finance, Marketing, or Artificial Intelligence**, helping organizations make smarter, faster decisions using data. As a young professional, I’m excited to connect with opportunities that challenge me and help me grow.

## 🎯 What I’m Passionate About

- 📊 Using analytics to make smarter business decisions  
- 🌐 Exploring how data impacts industries like finance, supply chain, and tech  
- 🧠 Continuously learning from communities, podcasts, and hands-on projects

## ✨ Outside of Academics

When I’m not deep into data models or dashboards, you’ll probably find me:

- 🧳 Traveling or enjoying time outdoors  
- ⚽ Watching Chelsea matches (my all-time favorite team!)  
- 🏀 Playing sports like soccer and basketball  
- 🎙️ Tuning into podcasts about business, investing, or soccer news  
- 🌱 Joining school clubs, networking at business events, or volunteering in the community

I'm always open to learning something new, meeting like-minded people, and growing both personally and professionally.

## 🏞️ Life Beyond the Classroom

Whether I’m skiing in the winter, exploring art, or traveling to new places, I believe experiences outside the classroom shape who I am just as much as my academic journey.
